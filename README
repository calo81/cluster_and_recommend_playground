Insurance customer similarities
=====================================

User based similarities to show infromation to new customers.

Based on (in order of priority):

- Trade (though only landlord at the beggining)
- Post code. First part of postcode. or all of it.
- Type of property
- Year of built.
- Type of tenant.
- number of bedrooms.
- Insurer


We assign Ids to each of these items:

So

Trade: 1
Post Code: 2
Type of Property: 3
Year of Built: 4
Type of tenant: 5
Number of bedrooms: 6

Each user will have an id as well. given by our system.


We will calculate the distance between every 2 post codes and then give wieghts to them to know which hare the nearest people.

Should we cluster user in trades adn post codes.

When we want boolean item values, we will put a value that ends in 153 (I made up this number). This means for values that if they are different they are different. there isn o notion of any two values being closer or farther fro meach other.


Example mongo documents:

{ "user_id" : 1,
  "item_id" : 1,
  "preference" : 1
  }
